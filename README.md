# Twitter Clone Project
Welcome to our Twitter Clone project! This is a web application that replicates some of the basic features of Twitter. It is built using Node.js and Express, and it utilizes MongoDB as the database.

## How to Use NPM Command to Start the Project
To start the project, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository using Git:
git clone https://github.com/jasonkim0110/project3.git

## Navigate into the project directory:
cd project3

## Install the project dependencies:
npm install

## Start the application:
npm start

## Starting the server
This will start the server on http://localhost:3003. 

You can access the application by navigating to that URL in your web browser.
That's it! You should now be able to use the Twitter Clone application. 
If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please let us know. We hope you enjoy using our Twitter Clone!
